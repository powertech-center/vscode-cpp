# PowerTech C/C++ for VSCode

This Extension is under development...

We care about Developers, so we create Simple, Powerful and Convenient tools for them. This Extension is intended for C/C++ Developers. We believe that the most functional, modern and promising compiler today is Clang ([LLVM](https://llvm.org) project), so we built our Extension relative to the Clang/LLVM infrastructure.

We are glad to offer you to download __PowerTech Clang__ fork. You will get not only all the standard functionality, but also additional ones, such as *Build Speed Boost*, *Cross Compilation*, *C/C++ Language Extensions*, etc.

We are constantly working to improve our tools, keeping them Simple, and we really hope that they help Developers do their work more efficiently:
* CMake syntax highlighting and IntelliSense (based on [CMake](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake))
* ToDo CMake commands
* ToDo C/C++ syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
* ToDo Debugging
* Old-school Themes (based on [Dev-C++ Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Guyutongxue.devcpp-theme) and [Delphi Themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.delphi-themes))
